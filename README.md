# ASTRUN1903_F22
Teaching materials for Astronomy Lab I (Fall 2022)

### Overall lessons learned:
* always include a lecture at the start on scientific concepts covered in the lab
* hand out paper copies of the lab with space underneath each question for students' responses; makes grading much easier
* note down students' feedback on each lab for 
* students *really* liked the shorter labs
* students *really* hated the first lab
* redo the rubric for the final project since it wasn't applicable to students who presented on scientific figures; old rubric was confusing so redo it nonetheless

## Thoughts on each lab:

### Lab 1 - Orders of Magnitude
Students' least favourite lab. Too much math. They didn't know how to convert units and what orders of magnitude were. Despite telling them to show their work, and always include units, I still had to take off many points. This was the lowest lab for many students; average was 78%.

#### Improvements for next time:
1. shorten lab
2. lecture at the start on how to convert units, do algebra (ie. m/s to km/h) and orders of magnitude

### Lab 2 - Height of Pupin
Students liked that this lab was shorter. But they still struggled with understanding what uncertainty/errors are.

#### Improvements for next time:
1. lecture at the start on different examples of errors (ie. tick marks on a ruler, errors for a scale, errors on a graph, etc)

### Lab 3 - The Earth
Covered by Ben Cassese.

### Lab 4 - Observing Lab I: The Moon
Covered by Matthew Scoggins.

### Lab 5 - Earth, Moon & Sun
Good review for their midterm in Earth, Moon & Planets class.

#### Improvements for next time:
1. questions were repetitive
2. remove the 'person on nose' exercise 

### Lab 6 - The Sun Lab
Students didn't understand how we can see a hot star (10,000K) as blue since it's wavelength doesn't fall in the visible spectrum. Didn't understand the blackbody spectrum. Students didn't like Section 3 where they had to use the software and formulate questions. The software was confusing and incomplete, and they struggled with coming up with questions. Older labs had an additional section which used another online software - https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/labs/lab/sun/research - but the sofware was done. 

#### Improvements for next time:
1. lecture at the start of class on electromagnetic spectrum
2. remove section 3 - or find an alternative interactive software

### Lab 7 - Exoplanets
Gave a short lecture on the different detection methods. Students didn't like that there was lots of writing. The software was straightforward.

#### Improvements for next time:
1. specify how much they should write
2. request they use Google docs instead of writing by hand

### Lab 8 - AMNH Lab
Students enjoyed the visit to the museum. Scheduling and booking tickets was annoying, but it was possible.

### Lab 9 - Observing Lab II: Ancient Astronomy
Covered by Matthew Scoggins

### Lab 10 - Astrobiology
Students didn't like that there was lots of writing. Had to explain was the units of $f$ in the Drake equation were. They didn't like the guesswork in section 5.

#### Improvements for next time:
1. specify how much they should write
2. request they use Google docs instead of writing by hand
